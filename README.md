# CCAPDEV-MCO
Mhm, some web application. Created for CCAPDEV (Web Application Development).

## Limitations and Possibly Errors of the WIP Web Application

1. The Web App assumes that the user is
    - automatically logged in,
    - and is BOTH a user and an admin
    hence why a student account (Enzo Rafael Chan) has admin privileges. This is to simply show features that the admin can access.

2. The Web App also has not implemented the log-out feature. However, in the foreseeable future, features such as Managing Reservations and Edit Profile will be locked if logged out.

That's all.
